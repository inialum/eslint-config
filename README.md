## Release

1. Update version in `package.json` locally  
   You can use `pnpm version [patch|minor|major]` to update version. This will also create a new commit and tag.
2. Push the changes to the repository  
   When you push Git tags, GitHub Actions will automatically create a draft release.
3. Publish a new release in GitHub  
   Access the [releases page](https://github.com/inialum/eslint-config/releases) and edit the draft release to publish it.
   When you publish a release, GitHub Actions will automatically publish the package to npm.
